    <h2>Redesigning Learner Resources Page</h2>
    <p>My Role: Ideation, wire-framing, user testing, prototyping, visual/brand design, interaction design</p>
    <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
    <p>Decoded is an NYC based tech education company that delivers facilitation
      sessions to companies in order to get them up to speed on technical concepts
      such as big data, AI, blockchain, and increase their digital literacy.
    </p>
    <h3>TASK</h3>

    <p>
      Following a facilitation session, many users are looking for a way to stay
      engaged with the material. Decoded facilitators are able to offer their current
      resources page, but it is limited in what it offers and does not facilitate
      long-term engagement from the users following a session.

      <br><br>

      As a UX Design intern, I was tasked with conducting a review and redesign
      of the resources page with the goal of improving the end-to-end learner
      experience and deliver a more positive off-boarding experience via the
      resources page.
    </p>

    <h3>METHODS</h3>

    <p>
      I approached this redesign by conducting a discovery phase in which I spoke
      to members of both the company’s US and UK teams to gain insight into their
      perspectives on the current state of the resources page.

      <br><br>

      With these objectives in mind, I used a combination of Sketch and Adobe XD
      to design a high-fidelity digital prototype that addressed the above pain
      points in the following ways :

    </p>

    <ul class = "project_list">
      <li> Information was organized into the company’s 4 Mindsets : Data, Hacker, Innovator, Developer</li>
      <li>Incorporated a greater emphasis on visual design, as well as copy</li>
      <li>Give users the ability to personalize their experience via the
         ability to log in to their own account and then save/favorite content
         to a “My Resources” page </li>
    </ul>


    <p>
      Using this first prototype, I then recruited 5 users from the office for
      an informal click-through usability testing session, with a think-aloud
      component to the test. They were given 4 very basic tasks, and then presented
      with a set of debrief questions after the test.

      <br><br>
      Following the user testing, I categorized the findings into positive feedback,
      mixed feedback, and negative feedback.
      <br><br>

      I then worked to iterate upon this feedback.
    </p>

    <h3>KEY LEARNINGS</h3>
    <p>The main goal of this redesign was to provide an experience through the
        resources page that motivated users to return to the page and continue
        using it, thereby maintaining the company-client relationship for longer.
        However, upon conducting the user research, it became clear that the
        initial design did not achieve this.

        <br><br>
        Having to in some ways, return to square one after testing was a major
        obstacle and challenge that I faced during this project. However, it was
        also an incredibly valuable learning experience.

        <br><br>

        I definitely learned the importance not only of a user testing phase,
        but also of asking the correct questions and choosing the appropriate
        method of user testing. If I had solely relied on a think-aloud protocol,
        I would not have been able to ask the pointed questions I wanted, and conversely
        had I only relied on a set of predetermined interview questions, I might
        have missed key information that the users had to share.

        <br><br>

        This project was also crucial to my understanding of brand identity and
        visual design as a part of a holistic user experience.

        <br><br>

        Ultimately, this was a formative experience in my growth as a designer,
        as I worked under the pressure of deadlines to deliver a solution that
        did not operate in a vacuum or as a standalone product, but rather needed
        to fit seamlessly into the end-to-end user experience.
    </p>

    <h3>OUTCOME</h3>

    <p>
      The final outcome addressed the functional issues brought up in the user testing
      sessions, while stripping back the visual design to fall in line with the brand
      identity that is consistent with the existing Decoded suite of products,
      so as to be more familiar and usable to the company’s global user base.
