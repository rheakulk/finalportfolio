    <h2>Creating User Friendly Training Modules</h2>
    <p>Team Members: Oshin Nayak, Hans Lee, Tianny Lu</p>

    <p>My Role:  Initial ideation, user research, interaction design </p>
    <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
    <p>Redgate’s SQL Search is an extension of SQL Operations Studio. This is a
      tool targeted towards a user base with limited SQL knowledge that aims to
      allow its users to easily parse through fragments of SQL in tables, and
      quickly navigate through hundreds of objects in a server.
    </p>

    <h3>TASK</h3>

    <p>
      Data Driven Detroit, an organization seeking to deliver high quality
      information in an accessible way in order to facilitate data-backed decision
      making by its customers, tasked our team with creating a user-friendly
      training module for their open source tool: State of the Detroit Child.

      <br><br>

      The tool displays and delivers large quantities of complex data about
      the community, and the existing tutorial did not adequately facilitate a
      seamless and smooth user experience when navigating the tool.



    </p>

    <h3>METHODS</h3>

    <p>
      Our first step was to analyze the existing tutorial, and identify key
      interaction points in order to create a breakdown of the existing user-flow.

      <br><br>
      We then reviewed the existing user research and conducted stakeholder interviews
      to gain insight into what users liked/disliked about the tool.
      To then synthesize actionable insights from our research phase, we created
      an affinity diagram and categorized our observations.

      <br><br>
      We were finally able to take our research findings and move into the design
      phase. The first step was to ideate as a team, creating hand-drawn sketches
      and paper prototypes, which we then translated into low-fidelity wire frames.

      <br><br>

      After reviewing our sketches, we moved towards creating low-fidelity
      wireframes before moving into the higher-fidelity prototyping phase.

      <br><br>
      After reviewing low-fidelity paper prototypes and wireframes through hallway
      usability testing and peer critiques, we constructed a high fidelity prototype
      of the tutorial that took all of our findings and research into consideration.


    </p>



    <h3>CHALLENGES</h3>
    <p>This was a valuable lesson regarding working with considerable constraints.
      Building a tutorial for a tool that was already launched and in use meant that
      we did not have much flexibility in terms of changing the design of the tool.




        <br><br>
        Therefore, although we wanted to create a solution that rebuilt the
        wheel and solved all apparent issues, as designers we had to not meet
        stakeholder needs that included not only the users, but the client as well.

        <br><br>

        This challenged us as designers to ideate and create a solution that
        fit within the client’s constraints, while still providing a meaningful
        improvement to the users



    </p>

    <h3>OUTCOME</h3>

    <p>
      The final product was a high fidelity digital prototype that addressed
      what we saw as the most pressing usability issues with the existing tutorial.
      This included an indication of a user’s progress through the tutorial, the use
      of modules rather than pages, providing in-context tooltips, and emphasizing
      interactivity rather than static indicators.

      <br><br>


      The final solution implemented a checkbox and filtering system that was
      more conducive to mass selection/modifications of tracked connections.
      I also improved the copy of the interface to be more consistent and provide
      a more reliable mental reference model for the user.

      <br><br>

      <img src = "images/ddd1.png" class = "ddd_outcome">
      <br><br>
      <img src = "images/ddd2.png" class = "ddd_outcome">
      <br><br>
      <img src = "images/ddd3.png" class = "ddd_outcome">

      <br><br>

      This ultimately led to a tutorial that made the tool much more learnable
      for users and will hopefully lead to a greater rate of user retention for
      the client.
