    <h1> About Me</h1>
    <div class = "about_text">
    <h2> Hey again! Like I said, my name's Rhea </h2>
    <p> I’m a UX designer who loves working with people and technology.
      I have a technical foundation in programming that allows me to both empathize with the
      needs of the end-user as well as understand the technical requirements of a project.<br><br>
      Thus, I ensure both are considered when delivering a final product. As a designer, I firmly believe in
      adopting a user-centered design approach that anchor the end-user at the heart of every decision I make.<br><br>
      I thrive on projects that allow me to leverage my technical and visual design skills, as well as my genuine
      excitement for working with users to understand their needs on a human level.<br><br>
      I ultimately strive to find ways to seamlessly integrate technology into people’s lives and
      deliver experiences that are intuitive, meaningful, and innovative.<br><br>
      When I’m not working, you’ll find me taking long, aimless walks to explore whatever city
      I’m in and finding coffee shops, scoping out my next favorite ramen spot, or re-reading
      Game of Thrones for the hundredth time.
