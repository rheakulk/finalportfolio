    <h2>Redgate Software SQL Search Extension</h2>
    <p>Team Members: Callum Brown</p>

    <p>My Role: Initial ideation, wire-framing, rapid-prototyping, high-fidelity digital prototyping</p>
    <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
    <p>Redgate’s SQL Search is an extension of SQL Operations Studio. This is a
      tool targeted towards a user base with limited SQL knowledge that aims to
      allow its users to easily parse through fragments of SQL in tables, and
      quickly navigate through hundreds of objects in a server.
    </p>

    <h3>TASK</h3>

    <p>
      SQL Search Extension is a tool that allows users with limited technical
      knowledge to easily parse through fragments of SQL in tables, and quickly
      navigate through hundreds of objects in a server they have connected to.

      <br><br>

      As a UX intern I was tasked with delivering a more streamlined and intuitive
      experience in regards to how a user manages the servers they are connected
      to by working to enhance the overall user experience of the tool.

    </p>

    <h3>METHODS</h3>

    <p>
      Given the infancy of this product and its consequent lack of users we adopted
      a hypothesis-based approach wherein we began by identifying the following
      key potential pain points, most of which centered around the fact that the
      interface was not conducive to mass selection/modification, and that the
      copy of the interface was confusing.

      <br><br>

    </p>

    <ul class = "project_list">
      <li> Users are unable to efficiently manage their tracked connections
        because of the limited capabilities provided by the interface</li>
      <li>The interface copy is unclear and does not communicate what certain
        actions or components mean</li>

    </ul>


    <p>
      Thereafter we created rapid paper prototypes of possible interfaces and
      interactions, moving towards higher fidelity prototypes on Sketch later.

      <br><br>
      The first iteration of paper prototyping (pictured above)  saw a design
      that implemented a filtering system to allow for efficient selection, as
      well as a split screen view that would allow users to compare their selections
      alongside with all the available items they manage. The idea behind this
      iteration was to allow for greater visibility and transparency in the design.


      <br><br>

      These designs were presented to the design team manager for feedback and
      critique, which were then implemented into higher fidelity digital prototypes
      using Sketch.
    </p>

    <h3>CHALLENGES</h3>
    <p>The highly technical product domain came with a  steep learning curve
      that made it difficult to empathize with users, as this was not a product
      that I was ever going to be using in my day-to-day life.


        <br><br>
        However, I was able to leverage my technical background and knowledge of
        SQL and data analysis concepts in order to translate technical requirements
        into design decisions that led to an intuitive and usable experience.



        <br><br>

    </p>

    <h3>OUTCOME</h3>

    <p>
      The final solution presented a more stripped back version of the initial
      paper prototype, having decided against both the filtering and the split
      screen view as what was initially seen as increased visibility was actually
      more of an information overload.


      <br><br>


      The final solution implemented a checkbox and filtering system that was
      more conducive to mass selection/modifications of tracked connections.
      I also improved the copy of the interface to be more consistent and provide
      a more reliable mental reference model for the user.

      While we ultimately  were not able to fully design and implement our final
      solution due to time restrictions, given the extensive iteration process
      that we went through we feel that we have left the team with strong and
      actionable steps with which to move forward with the new UI.
